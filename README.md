#Compiler For MyML
### Overview 
This project is a compiler for the MyML programming language, which is a simplified version of ML. The compiler takes the MyML code as input and produces P-code, a lower-level representation of the code that is optimized for execution.

### Compilation 
```
make 
./compil.sh test*.ml
cat tst/test*.ml

```
